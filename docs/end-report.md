## 1. Project Overview

The goal of our project was to develop a reference management web application that supports importing and exporting BibTeX data, editing references through a web interface, and automated end-to-end testing using Robot Framework.

## 2. Sprint Summaries and Challenges

### Sprint 1 – Setup and Basic Functionality
- Set up the Flask backend, database, and basic front-end views.
- **Challenges:** coordinating in remote-work environment dividing work into tasks without interdependencies. Building the project on top of the course boilerplate.

### Sprint 2 – Support for BibTeX-reference types and Editing feature
- Implemented BibTeX-support.
- Added editing functionality
- Switched to SQL Alchemy Orm.  
- **Challenges:** Changes were time-consuming and it was necessery to better estimate the managable workflow for the next sprint to ensure good work quality.

### Sprint 3 – Search feature
- Refactored UI for better visual styling.  
- Added search feature.
- Stabilized architecture  
- **Challenges:** Parallelising work was challenging along with time-consuming architectural updates.

### Sprint 4 – Import/Export feature
- Added import and export features
- Unified all resource files and cleaned test architecture.  
- Improved communication between frontend and backend for file uploads.  
- **Challenges:** merging concurrent test and UI updates.

## 3. What Went Well
- Smooth collaboration with clear Git branching and review process.  
- Robot tests helped with code quality and maintainability.  
- Consistent documentation and readable resource structure.  
- Everyone contributed to planning, code structure and testing.

---

## 4. What Could Be Improved
- More consistent sprint planning, sometimes multiple tasks overlapped near deadlines.  
- Working on different branches turned out challenging and time-consuming. Using less branches in the last sprint improved work flow and helped with merging conflicts and overlapping work.

---

## 5. What We Learned
- Effective use of Unittests to ensure code functionality in backend
- Robot framework for end-to-end testing.  
- Handling complex parsing (BibTeX import/export) and validating input.  
- Coordinating teamwork through communicating channels, GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
- Working in collaboration with the product owner and offering agile methods to support their needs.

---

## 6. What We Would Like to Learn Next
- Collaborating in bigger groups with more complex projects
- Better understanding the different phases of the project to maximize work not done, to produce more value to the product owner and further implement systematic work strategies.

---

## 7. Reflection
The project was an invaluable experience to learn working as a member of a group. Projects like this always come with challenges ranging from overlapping work to technical details and having hands-on experience was necessary to understand the ideology behing agile methods. Unfortunately the project was quite short as much more could have been learnt. Despite that it was a good fit for the course as there will be a bigger course specifically for more challenging project and this was a necessary step in understanding what areas to improve.
